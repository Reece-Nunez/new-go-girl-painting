    text: 'We were introduced to Missy through mutual friends for a large job that we needed to complete. Missy came and gave a fair assessment and bid. Missy not only completed the entire project on time she shared her design eye with us to make sure that we used the correct color combinations. The job had some very difficult aspects to it but she delivered on all her promises, and it was a pleasure to work with her. I would recommend Missy to anyone that needs a painting project completed.',

    text: 'I‚Äôd highly recommend Go-Girl Painting, Missy was very nice to work with when it came time to paint our homes exterior. She provided excellent communication from the very start, and worked to fit us in at the last minute on Father‚Äôs Day! She was so kind to my curious 7 year old who wanted to watch her work and even got to do some painting. Very reasonable and upfront pricing and quality work. We love the way our home looks!',
